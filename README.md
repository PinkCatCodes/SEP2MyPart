# SEP2MyPart.
This is a part of our second semester project. I was responsible for creating a User, Signing up and Logging in.
We were a group of 5 people following SCRUM. Java and Javafx were used. We created a database in Postgres.
The project was about swapping Vynil records and creating a community at VIA. 
In a full app a User was able to create a profile, login, chat, add Vynil records and see available records.
